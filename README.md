# Nic's Sandbox

## Purpose

I see cool things on Twitter that I want to tweet about or blog about and I needed a place to just do stuff quickly.
This felt like the easiest solution to avoid a billion repos with 1 script each!

## Socials

I write at [blog.paynepride.com](https://blog.paynepride.com)
I goof off on [my twitter](https://www.twitter.com/pypeaday)
